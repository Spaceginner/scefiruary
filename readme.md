# scefiruary.

an emulator for scenite firuary cpu.

## huh?

this is a rust library. it provides a simple way to emulate this cpu. [cpu docs](https://rentry.co/scenite_firuary_doc).

## state

emulator is rn kinda WIP. doesnt even support full set of instructions.

## examples

they are located in `example_programs` folder

to compile them, you can use [assembler](https://github.com/Spaceginner/scefiruarier),
and to run you can use `sfemu` binary (`cargo run --bin sfemu -- <executable path>`)
